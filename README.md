# book_wishlist
* Requirement
Please create a RESTful API in Python 3 to manage a user's book wishlist. Please feel free to use any web framework or other tools of your choice. This includes any database of your choice, though we would recommend SQLite for portability.
 
We would like to see API calls to add, update, or delete books from a user's wishlist.
 
For convenience, we've included what attributes users and books should have:
•	User
  o	First name
  o	Last name
  o	email
  o	Password
•	Book
  o	Title
  o	Author
  o	ISBN
  o	Date of publication
 
Tests are required.
Auth is not required.
 
Please also include a write-up of design and technology choices.
Extension for document – If you have to scale your API to GoodReads scale. What would you change in your design. Include any design diagrams that help us understand it better.
